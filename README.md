# 🏡📊 MA Thesis Project: Human Activity Recognition with Smart Home Data
## 📝 Description
This repository contains the code I am developing for my MA thesis on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smart home data.
## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress (WIP)
Better organization of files and descriptions are coming soon!
## 📂 What's Inside
This repository covers working with timeseries sensor data in preparation for a model training, including:
- 📡 Data Acquisition: Communicating with a local InfluxDB instance to collect and save sensor data to .csv files.
- 🧹 Data Processing: Transforming, resampling, denoising, synchronizing, and merging timeseries sensor data.
- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization: Generating statistical summaries based on annotated episodes, creating scatter plots, timeseries graphs, and histograms from sensor readings.
- 🏷️ Data Annotation: Annotating sensor data using predefined episodes.
- 📁 File Management: Splitting timeseries data into daily or episodic segments.
# 🛠️ Usage Instructions
To run the scripts, you must create a .env file with environment variables for paths and database credentials. The .env file is not included in this repository to protect privacy and security.
## 🗂️ .env File Example
```
# Directory Paths
BASE_PATH=/module_path/
DATA_PATH=/path_to_data/
ANNOTATIONS_FILE_PATH=/path_to/annotations.csv
OUTPUT_PATH=/output_path/
LOGGING_PATH=/path_to/logs/

# Database Connection
HOST='localhost'
PORT=8086   # typically
DATABASE_NAME='name_of_your_database'

# Coommunication with the Chat Academic Cloud API
CHAT_AC_API_KEY='yourKey'
CHAT_AC_ENDPOINT='https://chat-ai.academiccloud.de/yourEndpoint'
```
## 📌 Explanation of Environment Variables
- `BASE_PATH`: Directory containing all Python files for this project.
- `DATA_PATH`: Directory containing database files (e.g., .csv files with annotations or sensor data).
- `ANNOTATIONS_FILE_PATH`: Path to a .csv file with annotated episodes. Every episode is a row. It must include the following columns:
    - `start`: Episode start time (e.g., 1733353200000 – UTC milliseconds, Europe/Berlin timezone).
    - `end`: Episode end time (see the format above).
    - `annotation`: Activity class (e.g., 'sleeping', 'airing').
- `OUTPUT_PATH`: Directory for storing all output files.
- `LOGGING_PATH`: Directory for structured logs.
- My database engine is InfluxDB (version 1.x). The API requires `HOST`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE_NAME`.
- I used the [Chat Academic Cloud API](https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/saia/index.html) when working with Foundation Models. I needed an API key `CHAT_AC_API_KEY` and an endpoint address `CHAT_AC_ENDPOINT`.
## 🚀 Possible Pipeline (WIP, TODO)
1. Data Collection:
    - Create an Annotation File: List all annotated episodes and parse them using `parse_annotation_file.py` to ensure compatibility with other scripts.
    - Download Sensor Data: Retrieve data from your InfluxDB instance and export it to .csv files using scripts in the `databank_communication` directory.
2. Initial Data Exploration: Inspect your annotated data using `explore_data_pandas.py`, `visualize_data.py`, `summarize_classes.py`. Look for errors (e.g., sensor malfunctions), duplicates (e.g., multiple logs of the same event), missing or infinite values.
3. Data Cleaning: 
    - Resample Data: Standardize sampling rates with `resample_df.py`. Sensors may have missed intervals (e.g., due to connection drops).
    - Denoise Data: Remove outliers from faulty sensor readings using `denoise_data.py`.
    - Synchronize Data: Align start and end times of all sensor recordings using `synchronize_data.py`.
4. Data Exploration: Re-examine your data to ensure cleaning hasn't introduced errors with `explore_data_pandas.py`, `visualize_data.py`, `summarize_classes.py`. If you see that the fridge opened at 3 AM, question your assumptions about the culprit. Is this a data issue or a sneaky partner? (Probably the data!)
5. Data Correlation: Identify relationships between sensor readings to uncover patterns. Use: `visualize_data.py`.
6. Data Filtering: Reduce redundancy by removing highly similar or irrelevant data to retain only meaningful features for model training. Use `filter_df.py`.
7. Data Segmentation & Balancing with `separate_into_episodes.py`
    - Segment Data: Split timeseries into episodes, e.g., daily or activity-based segments.
    - Balance Classes: Adjust for imbalanced activity distributions (e.g., too many ‘sleeping' episodes, not enough ‘cooking').

# 💡 Notes & Philosophy
- This code is structured based on my thesis needs (e.g., sensor types, locations, sampling rates), so it may not be plug-and-play for others. But hey, that's what academic projects are all about! Full project details will be in my thesis.
