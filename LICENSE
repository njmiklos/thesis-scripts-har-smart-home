ðŸ“¢ In Short (A Friendly Note from Me):
- I retain ownership of the code, but you can use it freely under these terms.  
- Honestly, this code is nothing you canâ€™t find online, just better documented and less optimized.  
- Feel free to reuse it, modify it, or even train your AI on it.  
- If you find it helpful and use it in your work, Iâ€™d appreciate a shoutout. I like positive attention. :-)
